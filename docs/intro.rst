Introduction
============

Installation instructions are based on the Raspbian distro for RaspberryPi, but it should generally work on every Debian based system, as long as the dependencies & requirements are met.

Usage
^^^^^
There are plenty of 'scripts' available online for performing DSMR readings. This project however is a full stack solution. This allows a decent implementation of most features, but requires a certain 'skill' as you will need to install several dependencies.

I advise to only use this tool when you have basic Linux knowledge or have any interest in the components used. I might create an installer script later, but I'll focus on the build of features first.
