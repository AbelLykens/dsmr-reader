Introduction
============

Why
---
There are plenty of 'scripts' and websites available for performing DSMR readings. This project however is a full stack solution and allows you to keep your own data for yourself, on your own RaspberryPi.

The project was originally started 'just for fun and learning', but kept growing until eventually other people were interested in using it theirselves as well. I also longed for a while to contribute something back to the open source community and this seemed the right project for it.

Skill
-----
The project is well documented, but requires a certain 'Unix skill' as you will need to install several dependencies using the command line.

I advise to only use this tool when you have basic Linux knowledge or have any interest in the components used. I might create an installer script later, but I'll focus on building more features first.
