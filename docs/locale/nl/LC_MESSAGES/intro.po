"There are plenty of 'scripts' and websites available for performing DSMR "
"readings. This project however is a full stack solution and allows you to"

"The project was originally started 'just for fun and learning', but kept "
"growing until eventually other people were interested in using it "
"theirselves as well. I also longed for a while to contribute something "
"back to the open source community and this seemed the right project for "
"it."

"This allows a decent implementation of most features, but requires a "

"I advise to only use this tool when you have basic Linux knowledge or "
