Home Assistant
==============

Since Home Assistant ``0.103`` there is `a DSMR-reader plugin available <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dsmr_reader/>`_, created by Wim Haanstra.
This plugin uses DSMR-reader's MQTT messages to read and update the state of your smart meter.

More details can be found on the link above.
