Common error resolution: How do I fix stats after smart meter replacement?
==========================================================================

Sometimes, when relocating or due to replacement of your meter, the meter positions read by DSMR-reader will cause invalid data (e.g.: big gaps or inverted consumption).
Any consecutive days should not be affected by this issue, so you will only have to adjust the data for one day.

The day after, you should be able to manually adjust any invalid Day or Hour Statistics :doc:`in the admin interface</tutorial/configuration>` for the invalid day.
