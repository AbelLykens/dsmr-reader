Troubleshooting: Debug info dump for GitHub issues
==================================================

You can supply additional debug info by executing the ``dsmr_debuginfo`` command and copying its output into your issue on GitHub.

To do so you can either execute ``./manage.py dsmr_debuginfo`` on the command line or (since v4.6) click the button on the About & Support page.
